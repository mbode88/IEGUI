Impact Extrusion Calculator (MATLAB)
Redistribution package of a MATLAB executable used to calculate material volumes used during the impact extrusion process for various types of tooling designs. Requires MATLAB to view source code.

Inputs to this calculator include parameters such as slug (material) density, tooling geometry and wall thickness. The volumetric extrusion process is 'simulated' by assuming an incompressible material and uniform flow. The output of the simulation is exact expected dimensions of the extruded can including base thickness, cone dimensions, wall thicknessees (multiple grades, as applicable) and wall heights.
